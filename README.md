# moodle-local_course_deprovision

This module is currently in development.
The goal is to create a modular plugin, which allows the deprovision of moodle courses. 
Deprovision therefore means the cleanup and deletion of courses after they are no longer used.
To be adaptable to the needs of different institutions the plugin will provide multiple subplugin types.
Those can be adjusted to the needs of your intitution.
